What's coming down the pipeline...

* Tests
* Shift package repo from DB to on-chain contract so that we can lookup UI by contract bytecode
* More types of inputs, e.g. date inputs
* Multi-stage panels (e.g. like Amazon checkout process)
* Formalisation of JSON specification
* Support for custom input fields (e.g. for multidimensional array input)
* Integrating with third-parties: wallet makers, etherscan, smartcontract.codes, etc.
