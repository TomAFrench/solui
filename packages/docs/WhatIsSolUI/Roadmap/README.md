What's coming down the pipeline...

* Tests
* Lookup UI by contract bytecode (already implemented, just need to wrap up API library!)
* Formalisation of specification
* More types of inputs, e.g. date inputs
* Support for custom input fields (e.g. for multidimensional array input)
* Multi-stage panels (e.g. like Amazon checkout process)
* Integrating with third-parties: wallet makers, etherscan, smartcontract.codes, etc.
