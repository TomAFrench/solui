For every panel in your Dapp, solUI keeps track of all the executions (both successes and failures) that occur in a given browser session.

To view the execution history of a given panel click the history icon button on the right:

![History button](../images/HistoryButton.png)

This will trigger popup which looks something like this:

![History list](../images/HistoryList.png)

You can then expand a previous execution to see its details as well as _retry_ it:

![History details](../images/HistoryDetails.png)

Clicking _"Replay"_ will cause the input fields in the panel to be set to the selected previous execution's input values, without automatically executing the panel. This gives you a chance to modify the values prior to execution.
